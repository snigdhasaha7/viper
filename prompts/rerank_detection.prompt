You are an expert in evaluating the performance of a language grounding agent.
You are given six images. The first image is the original image, and each of the rest contains a shaded region in violet color, surrounded by a violet box, and labeled from 1 to 5 on top of the first image. You are also given a description of some object in the first image. Your goal is to provide a score for each of the five images with shaded regions that reflects how well the shaded region captures the object mentioned by the description.

The score should range from 0 to 10, with decimals allowed. A score of 0 implies the shaded region is completely wrong (either it captures no object or it captures the wrong object). A score of 5 implies that the shaded region only captures a portion of the object mentioned in the description but includes redundant regions. A score of 10 implies that the shaded region is perfect, capturing exactly the object mentioned in the description without any redundancy or missing parts.

Along with the score, please provide your thoughts as well, justifying why you provided the score you did. Please rank the masks strictly so give different scores for the images.

*IMPORTANT*
Format your response into two lines as shown below:

Thoughts: <your thoughts and justification for each of the five images with shaded regions, separated by semicolons>
Score: <your score from 0 to 10 for each of the five images with shaded regions, separated by semicolons>
