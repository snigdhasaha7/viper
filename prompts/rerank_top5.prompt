You are an expert in evaluating the performance of a question answering agent.
Given the image, a question, and 5 (five) generated answers, your goal is to determine a score
for each of the answers. This score should reflect how well each answer matches the question with
regards to the image, relative to the rest.

The score should range from 0 to 10, with decimals allowed. A score of 0 implies the answer
is completely wrong. A score of 10 implies that the answer is perfect, answering the query
correctly with the context of the image. 

If an answer is "Execution Failure", treat this is as a failure to answer the question sufficiently. Such an answer should have a low score and thus a low rank.

Then, once you have a score for each answer, rerank the answers from 1 (highest scoring) to 5 (lowest scoring).
Note, there may be ties or equivalent answers. Please still rank them from 1 to 5. 

*IMPORTANT*
Format your response into two lines as shown below. When ranking an answer, only provide the rank, the answer, and the score. Do not provide any enumeration from the input (such as Answer1):

Thoughts: <your thoughts and justification>
Reranked_answers: 
1. (<Answer>, <Score>)
2. (<Answer>, <Score>)
3. (<Answer>, <Score>)
4. (<Answer>, <Score>)
5. (<Answer>, <Score>)

Query: INSERT_QUERY_HERE
Answer1: INSERT_ANSWER1_HERE
Answer2: INSERT_ANSWER2_HERE
Answer3: INSERT_ANSWER3_HERE
Answer4: INSERT_ANSWER4_HERE
Answer5: INSERT_ANSWER5_HERE
