While it has been played recreationally since then, it has gradually gained recognition as an official sport over the years. The Ultimate Players Association (now known as USA Ultimate) was founded in 1979, which helped to formalize the sport in the United States.\\n\\nInternationally, the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) was established in 1985 to govern the sport and organize international competitions. Ultimate was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2015, which marked a significant milestone in its recognition as an official sport on a global scale.\\n\\nSo, while Ultimate has been played since 1968, its journey to being recognized as an official sport has been gradual, with key milestones such as the founding of USA Ultimate in 1979 and IOC recognition in 2015.']",

They can be used to clean small, hard-to-reach areas such as grout lines, keyboard keys, or intricate details on household items.\\n\\n3. **Gardening**: Use the toothbrushes to gently clean dirt off delicate plant leaves or to help with planting seeds by making small holes in the soil.\\n\\n4. **Crafts**: Incorporate the toothbrushes into craft projects. For example, they can be used to apply glue or paint in a controlled manner, or even be part of a sculpture or mixed media artwork.\\n\\n5. **Science Experiments**: Use the toothbrushes in educational science experiments, such as demonstrating how bristles can be used to clean surfaces or exploring the concept of friction.\\n\\n6. **Pet Care**: Use a toothbrush to groom pets, especially for brushing the fur of small animals or cleaning their accessories.\\n\\n7. **Personal', 'brush teeth', 'toothbrush: brush teeth, toothbrush: brush teeth, toothbrush: brush teeth, toothbrush: brush teeth', 'It sounds like you have multiple toothbrushes and are looking for creative or practical uses for them.

The weight depends on the type of cargo and the number of cars.\\n\\n2. **Passenger Trains**: These are generally lighter than freight trains. A typical passenger train car weighs between 30 to 80 tons (27 to 73 metric tonnes). A full passenger train with multiple cars can weigh several hundred tons.\\n\\n3. **High-Speed Trains**: These are designed to be lighter for efficiency and speed. For example, a single car of a high-speed train like the Japanese Shinkansen or the French TGV might weigh around 50 to 60 tons (45 to 54 metric tonnes).\\n\\n4. **Locomotives**: The locomotives themselves, which provide the power for the train, can weigh between 100 to 200 tons (90 to 180 metric tonnes) depending on their size and type.\\n\\nThe total weight of a train is the sum of the weights of the locomotive', 'very heavy', 'heavy', 'very heavy', 'very heavy']",
